Abstract

This study explores two models for calculating the oscillation period of the compound pendulum affected by liquid damping. Theoretical derivations provide expressions for corrected periods, with one model assuming the damping force is directly proportional to velocity, and the other assuming it is proportional to the square of velocity. Experiments confirm the feasibility of small-angle approximations and investigate the relationship between rotation radius and period. Theoretical analysis using Python demonstrates the reliability of both models under a small radius of rotation of the mass center. Considering the computational complexity, the essay recommends the linear model for small radii and favors the squared model for larger radii when calculating period approximately.

	Introduction

Pendulums have long held a prominent role in our everyday lives, particularly within the fields of physics. These devices can be seen in various forms, from the playful swings that bring joy to children to the implementation of tuned mass dampers, which enhance the stability and safety of towering skyscrapers (Heffernan, 2015), and even extend to the field of rocketry, and a dual shock absorber system is employed to ensure the smooth launch by reducing excessive vibrations (Malik, 2008).

In physics education, the simple pendulum is a commonly taught concept (Suzuki, 2008), but scientists have expanded their research to explore the intricacies of compound pendulum systems (Hinrichse, 1981). However, most studies in this area have focused solely on ideal situations without considering the effects of friction (Feynman, 1963). It is important to correct these idealized models and account for damping conditions which can cause non-linear motion combined with chaos (Ji, Zhou, & Li, 2018), and difficult to calculate and understand (Peters, 2003). By incorporating damping effects, scientists can develop more accurate models and gain a better understanding of the real-world behavior of compound pendulums.

While some researchers have directed their attention toward investigating the effects of air friction on compound pendulums (Zhang, Wang, Qu, & Zou, 2008), an emerging area of interest lies in exploring the influence of liquid damping. By studying the behavior of these systems, we can gain valuable insights into their dynamics and further our understanding of their real-world applications.

When it comes to liquid damping situations, the theoretical calculation of the magnitude of viscous resistance is quite complex, which includes viscosity, mass, length, cross-sectional area, and so on. However, when discussing the effect of fluid damping, two simplified models are commonly used, one assumes that the friction acting on the pendulum is proportional to the velocity, while the other assumes that the friction is proportional to the square of the velocity (Lü, 2006). In this essay, we will calculate the period of compound pendulums with liquid damping using two previous approximation methods and compare the differences between these two methods and experimental results.
	Derivation
2.1 Liquid friction proportional to velocity

As we can see from Fig.1, assume the pendulum is acted by a gravitational force W, which is fixed at point O and has the center of mass at C. The distance between axes O and C is R, and the angle between the vertical line and OC is θ, while the pendulum is swung at angular velocity ω. Examining the forces acting on the pendulum reveals three components: gravitational force W, buoyance F, accounting for complete liquid submersion, the third is the most important, and the crucial frictional force f. In this situation, it is proportional to velocity, i.e.
f=-kv=-kRω
k here stands for the damping constant of the pendulum, and f is minus since it is opposite to the direction of rotation. According to the analog Newton’s Second Law in rotation
Iα=∑▒M	(1)
R.H.S. is the sum of all the moments, which can be expanded. By substituting all the forces and their moments, equation (1) can be written as
Iθ ̈=WRsinθ+FRsinθ+fR
Expand each term.

2.3 Checking and Verifications

In the culmination of our preceding computations, both methodologies have adeptly provided theoretical insights into the period of a compound pendulum influenced by liquid damping under distinct conditions. It is noteworthy that the utilization of approximations in both approaches serves the purpose of streamlining the differential equation into a second-order form. The judicious expansion of the exponential function is specifically aimed at obtaining an integrable function featuring a periodic component, such as the sin function.

In a general sense, we express the periods T as follows:
1. For the assumption where f=-kv=-kRω:
T=4π/√((4(m-ρV)gRI-k^2 R^4)/I^2 )

2. For the assumption where f=-kv^2=-kR^2 ω^2:
T=2π/√((m-ρV)gR(I-2kR^3 θ_0 )/(I^2-2kR^3 Iθ_0+2k^2 R^6 θ_0^2 ))

To assess the accuracy of both formulations, we evaluate the scenarios where k = 0 and ρgV = 0, signifying a scenario where the compound pendulum remains devoid of any liquid submersion and friction. Remarkably, in both cases, the derived periods converge to T=2π√(I/mgR), aligning with the theoretical period for ideal non-energy loss oscillations. This consistency reinforces the validity of our methodology.

An additional scrutiny is applied to the small angle approximation. Both approaches assert that for θ≪5°,sin⁡θ≈θ. However, a critical inquiry arises: can small angles be pertinent in the presence of substantial damping, as encountered in mediums like water, oil, or ethanol? Esteemed researchers (Alciatore & Histand, 2007) introduced a physical quantity δ, signifying the damping ratio where δ = (actual damping)/(critical damping). Over-damping conditions occur when δ>1, leading to the absence of observable periodic swings. To avert such scenarios and ascertain the suitability of liquid damping for most pendulums, experiments must be conducted to determine the feasibility of assuming small angles. This empirical validation is essential for refining our models and ensuring their accuracy under real-world conditions.

Moreover, while the two mentioned approximation methods provide distinct approaches for determining the period of a compound pendulum, they do not offer guidance on the preferred choice for predicting the pendulum's motion. For a more comprehensive understanding, additional experiments are imperative. These experiments serve to assess and compare the accuracy of both methods through controlling variables constant and only keeping rotational radius exchanging, thereby enabling the formulation of well-founded conclusions through a meticulous analysis of the experimental outcomes.
	Experiments
3.1 Rough Experiments

The preceding discussion emphasized the importance of experimental verification, prompting the need to assess the validity of assuming small angles. To tackle this, a rough experiment was carefully designed.

In the experiment, a long screw with a textured surface was chosen to simulate a compound pendulum. The textured surface was intentionally picked to highlight the impact of liquid damping on the pendulum's motion. It is noteworthy that a hole was carefully drilled through the screw to accommodate the axes for support. An iron support was strategically positioned to provide a stable horizontal foundation for the entire system. Copper wire served as the rotation axes, and though occasional loosening could appear, it was expected to have a minimal effect on the pendulum's period. 


	

To enhance measurement precision, the incorporation of cameras and slow-motion technology was employed. Video editing tools were subsequently utilized to tally the frames encompassing a complete oscillation period. Variable control was not implemented since this is an initial stage of validation, resulting in only a singular set of data being amassed. The experimental procedure was repeated four times, with the computation of an average value.
 
3.2 Formal Experiments

In the formal experiments, a cubic apparatus was designed to serve as a container for masses with diverse weights and densities. This arrangement aimed to alter the compound pendulum's inertia by adjusting the mass center's position. Through this method, the investigation delves into the connection between the oscillation period and the rotational radius of the mass center. Additionally, it enables a comparison of the precision achieved by both approaches.

The creation of this apparatus, requiring qualities of lightness, strength, and waterproofing, involves the utilization of a 3D printer for model fabrication. The chosen materials possess enhanced strength, the ability to adapt shape freely, and the capacity to generate noticeable friction on the pendulum.

Fig 3. Container and design diagram [blender]
The design of the experimental container has been carefully crafted to ensure the ease of inserting and exchanging masses during experimental procedures. A paramount consideration in this design is the necessity for waterproofing, aiming to prevent water ingress that might otherwise induce changes in mass and inertia, thereby potentially impacting the period of the pendulum. A lid is securely affixed at the container's base. Its position is reinforced by two nails and sealed with waterproof paper.

To maintain a balanced mass distribution, the container's main body is divided into two approximately equal halves. A long-threaded M8 rod passes through strategically placed holes on both sides of the walls, serving as the rotational axis. The tight securing of this axis is achieved by nuts and rubber silicone gaskets, and rubber bands are positioned around the slit between the two container halves. Tapes and fasteners are placed to improve the friction between the rotating axis and its supports. 

Arranged vertically, three iron stands support a horizontal beam, each standing in a different direction to ensure a stable foundation. Two clamps extend downward from the horizontal beam, firmly securing two bearings. Submerged in liquid, both the container and the axes create an environment of complete fluid damping. This condition is maintained by placing a substantial water bucket beneath the clamps, ensuring a consistent immersion. The accompanying pictures represent a complete view of the setup, prepared for experiments.

A set of precisely tailored masses is strategically chosen to maintain balance within the container. This decision ensures constancy across all variables throughout the experiments. A mobile phone, equipped with slow-motion video capabilities, aids in capturing convenient calculations of the pendulum's oscillation period.
 
Over ten experiments are conducted, introducing varying masses for diverse rotational settings. Adobe Effect (AE) is utilized for meticulous frame count tallying, with data systematically logged into a structured table. The experimental equipment is visually depicted in the accompanying figure and detailed in the concise table below for clarity.

4.1 Analysis of Rough Experiment 


 
Table 2. Data of rough experiments 
The obtained results were organized in a data table to determine the average outcome. However, special consideration was given to the performance during extended continuous swings. Over 60 periods were observed until the pendulum came to a halt, taking more than 40 seconds to complete. Theoretical calculations can also examine the result. The physical quantity δ can be calculated by δ=C/2m where mx ̈+Cx ̇+kx=0 (Zhen, Jia, & Fang, 2004). In (4) we have assumed that θ ̈+r_1 θ ̇+r_2 θ=0, leads to δ=r_1/2=(kR^2)/2I. Take the data below into it, δ=0.15<1, which is not over-damped. As a result, both observation and theories supported the notion that small angles could be reliably used as an approximation under conditions of liquid damping.

While the primary goal of this rudimentary experiment was to confirm assumptions regarding small-angle considerations, there is potential for additional calculations to be conducted. Taking all the variables, throughout the first method can get T_1=0.60±0.04 s. Simultaneously, the outcome of the second method is T_2=0.58±0.06 s. Notably, the results exhibit only a ±5% deviation from the actual value, affirming the accuracy of both formulas concurrently.

4.2 Analysis of Formal Experiment 
 
With a total mass of 110.70 grams and a volumetric capacity of 185.0 milliliters, the container stands at an overall height of 20.55 centimeters. Its halves, each measuring 10 centimeters in length, feature square-shaped cross-sections with sides of 3 centimeters. Within each half, a confined space unfolds, defined by square cross-sections, each side measuring 2 centimeters.

The following table presents fundamental data concerning nine distinct masses distributed across three different materials. It is important to note that the provided information is derived from measurements rather than predetermined parameters.

Furthermore, four blocks are selected for placement within the container, each positioned strategically to alter the rotational radius. The recorded periods are listed below.

Here, F1, F2, and F3 are the number of frames counted in the video editor, where 1 frame equals 1/240≈4.16ms, and T1, T2, and T3 are the time measured from the frame respectively.
Quantify the discrepancies using Python and the Matplotlib library to create a graphical representation. This graph will facilitate the comparison of divergences between experimental outcomes and the two methods utilized. To enhance precision, extend the analysis to various friction constants.

Based on the experimental data, two sets out of the eleven recorded exhibit substantial discrepancies, prompting their exclusion from subsequent calculations. Employing the functionalities of the numpy and scipy libraries, curve fitting in Python becomes an accessible task. The computation yields a value for k of 0.5 kg s^(-1), aligning seamlessly with the data obtained during experimentation. Simultaneously, by employing programming tools to assess the variance between experimental and theoretical values, we gain valuable insights into the most appropriate methodology to adopt.

Organizing the initial four datasets in ascending order, the var() function efficiently computes the variance across various models and data. Notably, the proportional model demonstrates a slightly reduced variance, underscoring its heightened reliability.
 
Fig 9. Log of the program using the first four sets of data [python]
Applying the same analytical approach to the latter four datasets, the program unveils a similar trend. Specifically, the squared model showcases a marginally smaller variance.
 
Fig 10. Log of the program using the last four sets of data [python]
The initial four datasets show small rotational radii, while the last four exhibits the opposite trend. This suggests that a first-order model effectively corrects the oscillation period when the suspension point is near the center of mass. Conversely, a second-order model is more suitable when the suspension point is farther from the center of mass.
4.3 Theoretical analysis

While conclusions have been drawn, the slight disparity in variance under a small radius state does not strongly support the adoption of the proportional model. Consequently, additional simulations are essential to assess the requisite application of models for stabilizing the oscillation period of a compound pendulum affected by liquid damping. This necessitates exploring variations in the friction constant.

From the previous experiments, k=0.5kg s^(-1). Keep other variables constant, where V=184.95ml, m=258.82g,θ=5°, only changing k from 0 to 2.5.

Fig 11. Effects of k on the period about radius [python]
The picture illustrates theoretical simulations depicting different resistant constants. Notably, in the squared model, as the radius increases, the period extends infinitely. This implies unreliability when both the constant and radius are large, but we need to notice that those values of friction constant are almost impossible. Furthermore, in situations characterized by low damping (k<0.5kg s^(-1)), there is a lack of pronounced disparities between the two methods when compared to the ideal scenario. Specifically, when k=0.05kg s^(-1), its curve closely aligns with the ideal curve. This emphasizes the subtle impact of damping on the oscillatory behavior of the system.

Generally, in small friction and a large radius condition, the squared model may exhibit higher precision. What’s more, when considering factors such as the complexity of formula derivations and the time required for calculations in environments without computer assistance, it is recommended to choose the proportional model under a small radius condition. 
 
4.4 Error and accuracy analysis

During experiments, variations may occur, affecting outcomes. While acceptable in initial hypothesis tests, caution is necessary in formal research. Inadvertent human errors notably compromised data integrity, as seen in the divergence of two unusable data sets.

Within the subset of results exhibiting a lower magnitude, the oversight of neglecting to secure a rubber band proved pivotal. This oversight allowed water to infiltrate the inner walls of the container, augmenting its mass and consequently reducing the measured rotational period. Conversely, the set of results displaying a higher magnitude is directly attributable to a wrong-adjusted weighting mechanism. In this instance, the misplacement of a plastic block instead of an aluminum block led to a decrease in mass. Thus, the gravitational force became insufficient to balance buoyance, resulting in a naturally inclined state, as illustrated in the accompanying diagram.








Fig 12. Buoyance higher than weight
In experimentation, uncertainties persist, notably in situations like the excessive rotation of a large-radius axis, exemplified by the M8 screw, causing fluid resistance. Despite the screw's grooves reducing resistance compared to a simple rod, the overall impact is challenging to quantify. Additionally, assessing lateral sliding resistance in the compound pendulum proves difficult due to its distinct calculation method for frontal force reception.

Moreover, water's fluidity and viscosity pose challenges. Hence, our approach relies on practical measurements for determining resistance constants, lacking precise control over this physical parameter.

	Conclusion and Reflection
5.1 Conclusion

Drawing upon the insights garnered from prior research and essays, two distinct methodologies have been identified for calculating and correcting the vibrational period of a compound pendulum under the influence of liquid resistance. Through theoretical derivation, we have formulated an expression to compute the corrected period.

In consideration of the feasibility of observing small angles, a rudimentary experiment was devised. Employing a simple apparatus, it was observed that small-angle oscillations were perceptible to the naked eye and exhibited sustained motion over an extended duration. This substantiates the viability of small-angle oscillations of the compound pendulum under liquid resistance, leading to the conclusion that θ can be employed as a direct approximation for sin⁡θ. Subsequent calculations further indicated that, under liquid resistance, the compound pendulum's small-angle periodic motion does not experience over-damping, which aligns with experimental expectations.

Subsequently, a formal experiment was conducted, providing a preliminary comparison and discussion of the accuracy of the two correction models. Considering the malleability of 3D-printed materials and the influence of observable friction, a cuboid container was designed. This facilitated the manipulation of variables by altering internal mass and its positioning to control the center of gravity, allowing for an exploration of the relationship between rotational radius and period. Python, Excel, and demos were utilized for data analysis, fitting, computation, and graphical representation. Leveraging these tools enabled a nuanced evaluation of the precision in period calculations between the two models, leading to the conclusion that a linear model should be adopted for smaller radii, while a squared model is more suitable for larger radii.

Finally, numerical calculations were performed using programming, and observations were made through graphical analysis. Gradually increasing the resistance constant revealed that, for k < 0.5 kg s^(-1), the corrected results closely align with the ideal scenario, indicating minimal damping effects on the compound pendulum, which can be directly using the ideal formula. As resistance becomes larger, the squared model demonstrates superior accuracy. 

In summary, considering the complexity of computational duration and formula derivation, although the linear model may introduce slight deviations, this essay recommends its use for approximations in a small radius of rotation. Moreover, when it comes to the rotational length of the mass center near the length of the pendulum, the squared model appears to be more accurate.
 
5.2 Reflection and acknowledgement 

Upon reflecting on my entire research, I noticed some areas that could be improved in my first independent scientific exploration.

Firstly, I faced challenges in the theoretical calculation part due to a lack of solid mathematical groundwork. This resulted in repeated deviations and issues during the deduction process, causing delays in my research plan and progress. The use of differential equations, which involves some advanced math, exceeded my current abilities and took nearly a month for confirmation.

Secondly, the experimental design fell short of achieving the desired goals. Originally, I intended to explore the relationship between periodicity and resistance coefficients, along with rotational radius. However, due to equipment shortages, I had to omit experimenting with different liquids and only conducted experiments in water. When analyzing changes in resistance coefficients, I relied solely on software for feasibility assessments, lacking empirical evidence. Consequently, the conclusions drawn in this paper are preliminary and should be viewed as initial insights.

Thirdly, there were notable errors during experimentation. While not explicitly reflected in the data, this paper simplifies the calculation of resistance coefficients, introducing imprecision. Mistakes during experimentation rendered two out of ten sets of data unusable. Moreover, the limited data sets fail to sufficiently support the drawn conclusions.

In conclusion, this research project served as a valuable learning experience, guiding me through the scientific inquiry process—from initial curiosity to literature review, theoretical calculations, rough and formal experiment design, execution, learning and using modeling and programming software, to data analysis, synthesis, and reflection. I extend sincere thanks to my mentor for guidance, the physics faculty for encouragement, the school laboratory for support, and my parents for their valuable advice.
