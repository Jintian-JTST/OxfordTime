Conclusion:
1. R is small, use proportional model. R is big, use square model.
2. Another set of data at 8<8<8.5cm is necessary to obtain.
3. R big conditions, should conclude the result from formal experiments.
4. R small conditions, both are OK.
5. When consider the calculating time factors, mention the difficulties not only in deriving the formula but also time needed to calculate the period of time. Square roots, differential equations, etc.
